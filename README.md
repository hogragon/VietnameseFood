# Vietnamese Food Discovery App

This application helps you discover random Vietnamese dishes, view their images, and learn how to cook them.

## How to Run Locally

This project is designed to run directly in your browser without any build steps, local server, or API keys required.

1.  **Download the Files**: Make sure you have all the project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, etc.) in a single folder on your computer.

2.  **Open in Browser**:
    *   Simply double-click the `index.html` file, or drag it into your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it! The application runs completely offline using a local dataset of Vietnamese dishes and sample recipes.
